    <title>Short Stories Showcase</title>

    <style>
      /* ──────────────── Code Overview ────────────────
       🎯 Purpose: Present short stories as elegant cards with image, teaser, and a full-story modal.
       🏗️ Layout: Centered grid of “story-card” items; each opens a native <dialog> with the full text.
       🎨 Theming: CSS variables (light by default) + automatic dark mode via prefers-color-scheme.
       🧭 Components:
           • .story-card      → Card shell (image, title, excerpt, “Read More” link)
           • dialog           → Native modal for full story (image + rich text)
           • .close-btn       → Inside dialog to close it
       ⚡ Interactivity: Minimal inline JS on links/buttons to open/close dialogs (showModal()/close()).
       ♿ Accessibility: Descriptive alt text; dialogs labeled via aria-labelledby; large tap targets.
       🖨️ Print: Dialog content becomes inline for clean paper/PDF export; decorative UI hidden.

          >Just before midnight, Sarah stepped onto the wind-polished platform
          of a town that looked like a memory—paint peeling, clocks stubborn,
          and every bench holding the shape of someone who had already left.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The conductor stood under the yellow cone of a lamp, hands folded behind
        his back like a patient question. “Last train,” he said, not unkindly.
        Steam stitched the cold between them. Sarah nodded and tightened her
        grip on a small canvas bag that carried less than she owned and more
        than she could explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her phone had died an hour earlier, somewhere between the final argument
        and the dark road that led to the station. There would be messages by
        now, apologies shaped like command. She could almost hear them in the
        hollow of the night. She looked down the track—two parallel convictions
        vanishing into a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Where to?” the conductor asked. His badge said M. Ilyas. His eyes said
        he had watched a thousand departures and never learned to be careless
        with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t know yet,” Sarah said. The answer surprised her by being true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ilyas considered this as though consulting a timetable in his head. “We
        stop at Brookline, Ferris, and Harbor. Harbor is the end.”
      </p>
      <p>“What’s at Harbor?”</p>
      <p>“An ocean,” he said. “And whatever lives beside one.”</p>
      <p>
        The train exhaled. Sarah bought a ticket whose destination felt like a
        hand she hadn’t shaken. In the carriage, the lights hummed softly, and
        the upholstery smelled of oranges and old rain. Opposite her, a boy
        slept with a book tented over his chest. A woman across the aisle
        unraveled a scarf of impossible blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Brookline, a man climbed aboard with a box that clicked faintly.
        “Beetles,” he told Ilyas, delighted by the way the word fit in his
        mouth. “A museum loan.” He sat beside Sarah and, sensing her worry,
        started speaking of carapaces and the patience of tiny lives. When he
        fell silent, the clicking went on, a metronome for courage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ferris arrived like a held breath. Sarah nearly stood—habit tugging at
        her sleeve. Ferris was the kind of town that knew her last name and the
        shape of her mother’s disappointment. The platform lamps wrote soft
        circles on the snow. No one got off. No one got on. The doors closed
        with the mercy of a gentle refusal.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You passed it,” the beetle man said, not looking at her. “Sometimes
        that’s the only way forward.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Past midnight, sleep took passengers one by one. Sarah watched herself
        in the window: a ghost trying on a body. She remembered learning to swim
        as a child, the way the ocean lifted her when she finally stopped
        fighting for the bottom. Harbor was still an hour away when she made her
        decision. It wasn’t a plan; it was the absence of a promise she no
        longer owed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harbor opened like a letter. The station smelled of salt and coffee.
        Vendors poured dawn into paper cups. The ocean didn’t roar; it breathed.
        Sarah stepped outside. Wind untied her hair. Somewhere gulls negotiated
        a truce. She found a bench that had not yet learned anyone’s shape and
        sat until the sky considered blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ilyas appeared with two cups. “Your stop,” he said, offering one. “Or
        your start.” He nodded toward the pier where a hand-painted sign
        advertised Rooms by the Week.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thank you,” Sarah said, and surprised herself again by meaning it for
        more than the coffee. She tore the ticket in half. The pieces didn’t
        float like in movies; they fell like small decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        By noon she had a room with a window the size of a choice. That night,
        the ocean kept time on the sill, and Sarah slept without the train
        inside her. In the morning she walked to the water and let it take the
        argument she couldn’t finish, the apology she didn’t owe, and the fear
        that her life would be a circle. The tide returned with her name spelled
        wrong and she laughed, and the gulls looked personally offended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weeks later, on a bus that smelled of pine cleaner, Sarah saw the beetle
        man again. He held the now-silent box. “They’re home,” he said.
        “Sometimes that’s the only way forward.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sometimes,” Sarah agreed. Behind the glass, Harbor kept breathing. The
        last train had turned into the first morning without a timetable, and
        for once, she was not late for her life.

          >Every summer, Daniel measured time by the shade of the oak. By noon
          the light sat on the ruined porch like a sleeping cat, and the letters
          he waited for never arrived.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        His grandmother had told him the tree was older than the house and
        kinder than most people. It held the hill together, she said, and
        sometimes it held people, too. When she died, the house learned how to
        echo, and Daniel learned that a mailbox can be loyal to emptiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        He kept writing anyway—small notes to a father who moved like weather,
        to a mother who loved him in present tense and panic, to a girl who had
        left with the first thaw. He folded each page into the same envelope and
        addressed it to a version of himself that lived on the other side of
        courage. He never mailed them. He hid them in a shoebox under the bed,
        which is to say he planted them in a room and hoped for rain.
      </p>
      <p>
        One afternoon, while the heat argued with the cicadas, he noticed a seam
        in the dirt where the roots rose like old knuckles. The ground had been
        disturbed. He brought a trowel and a glass jar and the kind of patience
        that belongs to people who talk to trees. A few inches down he hit
        metal—the lid of a biscuit tin, red once, now the color of remembering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside were letters, brittle as moth wings, tied with blue thread. The
        top one was addressed to <em>Whoever waits here</em>. The handwriting
        was neat and stubborn. He read on the porch while the shade slowly
        crossed his knees.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were love letters, of a sort, written by a woman named Salma to a
        man who had left for a war and sent back more silence than news. She
        dated each one and folded a pressed leaf inside, a record of seasons
        that kept the time he couldn’t. The last letter said:
        <em
          >If you come back and I am gone, know that I decided to stay
          anyway.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel felt something unclench in the house. He made tea. He wrote
        back—not to Salma, who required no reply, and not to the man, who had
        already chosen his distance, but to <em>Whoever waits here</em>. He
        wrote about the way the light moves on the porch and how an oak can be a
        calendar if you’re patient. He wrote about the mailbox, which was not
        the enemy after all, only a witness. He folded the letter around a leaf,
        tied it with thread stolen from the hem of a memory, and placed it in
        the tin.
      </p>
      <p>
        He put the tin back, deeper this time. He patted the earth as if tucking
        in a child. When he stood, the shade had reached the steps. The mailbox
        waited at the end of the drive, exactly as faithful as before. Daniel
        walked to it and opened the door. It was empty, which is another way of
        saying it was ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        That evening, the wind came up from the river and said a few kind things
        to the leaves. Daniel sat beneath the oak and read one of his old notes
        aloud. It sounded less like begging and more like weather—passing,
        necessary, unashamed. He did not stop waiting; he changed what he was
        waiting for. Sometimes the letters come, he would tell people later.
        Sometimes the tree answers instead. Both are good news.

      <!-- Prose content -->
      <p>
        <em
          >The storm broke over the old market like a confession, sending
          tourists under awnings and merchants into laughter. Only one doorway
          stayed bright—the lantern shop with moons and cranes hung in its
          window.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Leila slipped inside, rain in her sleeves, and the bell announced her
        with the polite enthusiasm of brass. The shop smelled of starch and ink
        and the quiet electricity of things made by hand. Lanterns in soft
        oranges and complicated blues drifted from the ceiling like patient
        planets. In the corner stood an old man on a stool, tying a filament to
        a wire frame with impossible fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If you’re waiting for the rain to ask permission, you’ll be here until
        spring,” he said without turning. His voice had the grain of an old
        song.
      </p>
      <p>“I’m hiding,” Leila confessed. “From a wedding.”</p>
      <p>“A good one?”</p>
      <p>“Probably,” she said. “Just not mine.”</p>
      <p>
        The old man climbed down. He wore an apron tattooed with the history of
        glue. “People come here to buy light,” he said, “but sometimes they just
        need a room where nobody is looking at them.” He set the lantern on the
        counter. “You can help me, if you like.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Leila took the offered seat and learned quickly, because her hands had
        been waiting to remember something. The frames were bamboo—bent and
        stubborn, like good advice. The paper was tougher than it looked. You
        had to wet the edges and coax them around the ribs. The old man showed
        her how to leave a small seam for air, how to press without bruising.
      </p>
      <p>“How many lanterns do you sell?” she asked.</p>
      <p>
        “Enough to keep the lights on,” he said, amused at the accuracy. “Not
        enough to stop making them.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside, thunder practiced its signatures on the sky. Inside, the shop
        practiced silence. Leila told the old man about the wedding—how her
        cousin had chosen a dress that looked like a promise someone else would
        have to keep; how her mother had chosen a table at the front because
        that’s where mothers keep their worries; how Leila had chosen the door
        and the rain and the lanterns because she didn’t yet know how to choose
        herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When I was your age,” he said, which is what old men are allowed to say
        if they also offer tea, “I followed a woman across a border because she
        said she was allergic to staying. We were married in a kitchen by a man
        who fixed radios. We lasted long enough to forgive each other for
        wanting different maps.” He poured tea into cups that had once belonged
        to certainty. “Sometimes light is not a thing you stand under,” he said.
        “Sometimes it is something you carry.”
      </p>
      <p>
        A boy came in for a lantern shaped like a carp. The old man chose one
        with scales drawn by a hand that knew rivers. He taught the boy how to
        hold it so the wire didn’t bite, how to swing it so the carp looked like
        it wanted to be exactly where it was. When the door closed, the shop
        accepted the quiet again.
      </p>
      <p>“Show me the one you made,” he told Leila.</p>
      <p>
        It was not perfect. The seam wandered like a thought. The paper puckered
        near the top where she had been impatient. But when he lit it, the
        lantern made a small, faithful circle of gold that contained her breath
        and the rain and the idea of a life she hadn’t yet admitted wanting.
      </p>
      <p>“You can take it,” he said. “It will cost you a story.”</p>
      <p>Leila laughed. “I’m short on good ones.”</p>
      <p>
        “Then take this: Once there was a woman who thought she needed
        permission to be happy. One day she found a shop where the owner
        accepted payment in future tense. She owed him the first story she lived
        on purpose.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The rain softened into the kind that forgives umbrellas. Leila stood to
        leave. “How will you collect?” she asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Trust,” he said, and shrugged, as if he’d been paid in worse
        currencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Months later, the wedding was a photograph on someone’s wall and Leila
        had a room with a window that knew how to hold morning. The lantern hung
        above her desk. In the dark it was simply an obedient moon. In the light
        it was paper and bamboo and the evidence of a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        She started walking to the market every Saturday. She learned to sand
        the bamboo so it wouldn’t snag the paper. She learned to paint small
        cranes that looked like they were deciding where to land. She learned
        that some days the shop sold three lanterns and some days it sold none
        and both were ordinary and survivable.
      </p>
      <p>
        One afternoon a man came in, wet and undecided, with a tie like an
        apology. “I think I’m hiding,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>Leila poured tea. “From a wedding?”</p>
      <p>
        He considered. “From a life I’m good at but not in.” He touched a
        lantern shaped like a moon and winced when the wire surprised him. “How
        do you hold it without getting hurt?”
      </p>
      <p>“You change your grip,” she said. “Or you learn where it bites.”</p>
      <p>
        When he left with a small sun in a paper cage, the shop was quiet again.
        The old man—who was sometimes there and sometimes not, as if shared by
        other stories—looked at her over his glasses. “You owe me,” he said, and
        Leila realized she had been paying in installments without noticing.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night she wrote a story at the desk beneath the lantern. It was
        about a storm and a market and a room where nobody was being watched. It
        ended with a woman buying her own permission. She brought the pages to
        the shop the next day and set them on the counter.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Paid in full,” the old man said, and hung her lantern in the window,
        where it taught the street a better color of light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, when the market changed and the rent multiplied like
        rabbits, people said the shop would close. But every time the rumor
        reached Leila, someone brought a story and left with light. The sign in
        the window never learned the word <em>Final</em>. The bell kept its
        polite enthusiasm. And if you were caught in a storm that wanted to be
        your excuse, you could still push the door and be announced, and inside
        there would be paper moons and painted cranes, and an old man or the
        idea of him, and a woman who knew how to hold a wire without getting
        hurt.
