SELECT        Makes.Make, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfModels
FROM   Makes INNER JOIN
 MakeModels ON Makes.MakeID = MakeModels.MakeID
GROUP BY Makes.Make
having COUNT(*) = (
select Max(NumberOfModels) as MaxNumberOfModels
from
(
SELECT      MakeID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfModels
FROM  MakeModels
GROUP BY MakeID) R1

)



-- My First Solution


select top 1  Makes.Make ,count(*) as NumberOfModels
from MakeModels
Inner Join Makes On MakeModels.MakeID = Makes.MakeID
Group by Makes.Make 
Order By NumberOfModels Desc;



-- My Second Solution

كنت فاعل السطرالخامس قبل الأخير
Makes.make
لكن هذا تكرار 
select   Makes.Make ,count(*) as NumberOfModels
from MakeModels
Inner Join Makes On MakeModels.MakeID = Makes.MakeID
Group by Makes.Make 
Having count(*)=
(
  select  MAX(NumberOfModels) as MaximumOfModels from
  (
     select    MakeID ,count(*) as NumberOfModels
     from MakeModels
     Group by MakeID 
  )  R1
);
