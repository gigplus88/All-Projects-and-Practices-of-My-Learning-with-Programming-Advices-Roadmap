  <h1>Demonstrating <code>line-height</code> with a Short Story</h1>

  <p class="normal">
    <strong>normal</strong>: As the sun rose over the sleepy village, Emma packed her bag and set off  
    down the winding path. Birds sang overhead, and the morning air smelled of dew and wildflowers.  
    She wondered what adventures the day would bring.
  </p>

  <p class="unitless">
    <strong>1.5 (unitless)</strong>: Marcus stepped onto the old wooden bridge, the river roaring  
    beneath his feet. He paused to admire the dancing reflections of light on water, then continued  
    his journey toward the distant mountains.
  </p>

   <p class="double-line-height">
    <strong>2x (double)</strong>: Marcus stepped onto the old wooden bridge, the river roaring  
    beneath his feet. He paused to admire the dancing reflections of light on water, then continued  
    his journey toward the distant mountains.
  </p>

  <p class="px-based">
    <strong>24px</strong>: A gentle breeze rustled through the wheat fields as Clara strolled at  
    dusk. She collected a handful of golden stalks, feeling the soft grain slip through her fingers,  
    and smiled at the horizon painted in shades of amber.
  </p>

  <p class="em-based">
    <strong>1.5em</strong>: Under the ancient oak, Samuel spread out his map and compass, tracing  
    hidden trails to forgotten ruins. The canopy above filtered the sunlight, creating patterns that  
    danced across the parchment.
  </p>

  <p class="percent">
    <strong>150%</strong>: The lighthouse keeper lit the beacon just as storm clouds gathered on  
    the horizon. Waves pounded against the cliffside, and the beam of light cut through the mist,  
    guiding sailors safely home.
