1. Declaring a Struct Variable Without new
When you declare a variable of a struct type without using the new keyword,
 the variable is not fully initialized. Structs are value types in C#, 
and they do not need to be explicitly initialized using new. 
However, if you don't use new, the struct's fields are not automatically initialized to their 
default values (unlike class instances, which are reference types and are initialized to null).


struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}

Point p; // Declared but not fully initialized
// p.X and p.Y are not initialized yet and accessing them will cause a compile-time error


Point p = new Point(); // Fully initialized with default values
// p.X and p.Y are initialized to 0

            //A struct object can be created with or without the new operator,
            //same as primitive type variables.

            stStudent Student ;
            stStudent Student2 = new stStudent();


            Student.FirstName = "Mohammed";
            Student.LastName = "Abu-Hadhoud";

   
            Console.WriteLine(Student.FirstName);   
            Console.WriteLine(Student.LastName);

            
            Student2.FirstName = "Ali";
            Student2.LastName = "Ahmed";
