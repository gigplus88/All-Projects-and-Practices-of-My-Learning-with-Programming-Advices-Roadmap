A service dependency is a relationship where one service (dependent service) relies on another service (dependency) 
to start and run properly. The dependent service cannot start until its dependencies have started.

A service cannot start unless all its dependencies are already running.
If a dependency service stops, the dependent service will also stop (depending on the configuration).
Dependencies are managed by the Service Control Manager (SCM).






3. Viewing Service Dependencies
You can view the dependencies of a service using the following tools:

A. Services Management Console (services.msc)

B. Command-Line Tools (SC Command)

C. PowerShell







4. Configuring Service Dependencies
You can configure service dependencies during service installation or manually.

A. Using Command-Line Tools
The sc config command allows you to specify service dependencies.
Syntax:
sc config <ServiceName> depend= <Dependency1>/<Dependency2>


B. Programmatically in C#
You can define dependencies when installing a service using the ServiceInstaller class.

Example Code:
using System.ServiceProcess;
using System.Configuration.Install;
using System.ComponentModel;

[RunInstaller(true)]
public class ProjectInstaller : Installer
{
    private ServiceProcessInstaller processInstaller;
    private ServiceInstaller serviceInstaller;

    public ProjectInstaller()
    {
        processInstaller = new ServiceProcessInstaller
        {
            Account = ServiceAccount.LocalSystem
        };

        serviceInstaller = new ServiceInstaller
        {
            ServiceName = "MyCustomService",
            DisplayName = "My Custom Service",
            StartType = ServiceStartMode.Automatic,
            ServicesDependedOn = new string[] { "RpcSs", "EventLog" } // Dependencies
        };

        Installers.Add(processInstaller);
        Installers.Add(serviceInstaller);
    }
}






6. Troubleshooting Service Dependencies
Dependency Not Starting:
Check the status of the dependency using services.msc or sc query.
Restart the dependency service.
Circular Dependency Error:
Avoid creating circular dependencies where services depend on each other.
Dependency Not Installed:
Verify that the required dependency service is installed and available.
Logs for Failures:
Use Event Viewer to check logs for dependency-related errors.
