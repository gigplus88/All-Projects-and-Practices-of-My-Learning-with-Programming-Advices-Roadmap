<!-- What is Specificity?
- Definition: Specificity is a system used by browsers to decide which CSS rule should be applied if multiple rules target the same element.

-How It Works: CSS rules are ranked by specificity in the following order (from highest to lowest):

1- Inline styles (e.g., <p style="color: red;">)
2- IDs (e.g., #header)
3- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes (e.g., .highlight, [type="text"], :hover)
4- Elements and pseudo-elements (e.g., p, h1, ::first-line)

- Imagine specificity as a contest 🏆 where the rule with the highest specificity takes home the styling prize! -->

  <h1>CSS Specificity Practice Activity</h1>
  <p id="special" class="custom" style="color: red; font-size: 22px;">
    This paragraph is styled using multiple CSS rules:
    <br>
    - The element selector (<code>p</code>) sets the base color to blue and font size to 16px.
    <br>
    - The class selector (<code>.custom</code>) changes the color to green and font size to 18px.
    <br>
    - The ID selector (<code>#special</code>) sets the color to purple and font size to 20px.
    <br>
    - Finally, the inline style overrides everything, setting the color to red and font size to 22px.
